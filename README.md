## Korg Nano KONTROL Studio control surface scripts for Bitwig

This is a modernization and update of the code forked from [here](https://github.com/olaims/nanoKONTROLStudio). The code is written in TypeScript and must be transpiled to JavaScript before copying it into the Bitwig scripts folder. If you'd like to make changes, go ahead and use `npm i` to accomplish all of that, and consider making a pull request.

The original code had no licence specified, so I'm going to publish my changes under the most permissible possible (MIT), but keep that in mind if you want to further fork the project.

Updated version by [Soaria](https://soaria.ca).

Thanks!
